                     BattleShip Pegs
            Mark your shots in Battleship on the computer,
              instead of using the red and white pegs.



KEYBOARD COMMANDS

Note that these keys only work when you are being prompted for the target
LETTER:  (S and ESCape will work Anytime.)

L   Display and search the 100 computer-selected  patterns that came with
    the Talking version of BattleShip.  If not using this version, these
    patterns can be used to set up your ships.

O   Quietly call a shot - Press the letter and number to call, and they
    will be displayed on the screen in a large font.  This can be used
    to call out shots to your opponent.

R   Choose a random, unmarked location to target.  The chosen square will
    be highlighted.  If you do not want to call this square, press ESCape.

S   Show the status of all ships.  Change the state of your own ships from
    here.

        P-Patrol Boat (2)   D-Destroyer (3)
        S-Submarine (3)     B-Battleship (4)
        C-Carrier (5)       Enter/space/ESCape-return

    SCORE is the number of hits on your opponent.
    SHOTS is the number of ships you have remaining.  (not sunk)     
          some variations give you X shots on each turn, where X is
          the number of ships you have still standing.

T   Show the five different types of ships.

Z   Hide your target grid until you press Z again.

ESC Quit the current game in progress.


After you win, lose, or press ESCape, you will be asked if you want to
play again.  You can press S at this point to see the ship status
screen.


GAMEPLAY
========
This program is not a BattleShip "game," instead, it allows you to mark your
shots.  This program is for those who have trouble using the standard pegs, or
for people that want to try this different approach to marking shots.


HOW THIS PROGRAM WORKS
======================
To start a turn, press the letter and number for the location you want to
shoot at.  Note to get the number "10," you press 0 when prompted for the
number.  Also, pressing the keys F2 to F10 will quickly call the respective
square.  (F3=call F 3)

Once you know weather it's a HIT or MISS, tell the program.  If you
got a hit, select the ship that was hit.  

Once a ship has taken the required number of hits to sink, the program will
tell you.  Sink all of your opponent's ships, and you rule the seas!


SHIP STATUS SCREEN
==================
The ship status screen shows the state of all ships in the game.  The ships
YOU are shooting at appear at the top, and your opponent's targets are at the
bottom.  Since the program can't possibly know when your ships get hit and
sunk, you have to tell the program about the changes.  Press P,D,S,B,C to
change the state of YOUR ships.

EXAMPLE:  Press "S" for submarine.  it changes from "Not located yet" to 
"1 hit taken."  Press it again to make it "2 hits taken."  Press it one more 
time to make it "SUNK!"  Pressing "S"  again will change it back to "NOT 
LOCATED" status.  Use this if you hit the wrong letter / change the wrong 
ship.

See KEYBOARD HELP, "S" for more


BATTLESHIP VARIATIONS
=====================
There are a few different ways to play the game of battleship.  Below are all
known variations.  If you have one you'd like to add, drop me an email and
describe the rules.  (contact info at end of file.)

1.  On a player's turn, only ONE SHOT is taken.  Regardless of a hit or a
    miss, the turn ends, and play passes to the other player.
	
2.  On a turn, each player takes one shot, and may keep shooting until he
    or she misses.  A player's turn ends after a miss.  

3.  ON a turn, each player takes one shot for each ship not sunk in his or
    her fleet.  For example, if you still have all 5 ships, you get 5 shots.
    If your opponent only has 3 ships left, he or she gets 3 shots.  (the 
    Ship status screen will tell you how many shots each player gets in this
    variation.)

4.  This game offers the most challenge for the "expert" player. It is
    played the same as game #3  above, except:
    . After a salvo of shots is called, the opponent simply announces how 
      many HITS were made - but NOT WHERE or on WHAT SHIPS.
    . Since players are never sure which shot was a hit in any salvo, they
      not use RED pegs in their TARGET GRID. If is advised to keep a record
      of hits for each SALVO on a separate piece of paper.  (The Ship Status
      screen will never show any hits, because neither you, or the program
      know where the hits are.  When a player has 17 hits, all of his or her
      opponent's ships have been sunk.)
