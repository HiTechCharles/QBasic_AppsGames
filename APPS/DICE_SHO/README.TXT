Dice Shooter by Charles Martin

When you start the program, you are asked how many dice you want to roll.  This number can be between 1 and 28.  Press ENTER when done.

At the next screen, you are shown the dice that were rolled.  The right side of the screen displays # of dice rolled, and the numeric totals.

You can press the following keys at this point:

    ENTER - Roll the specified # of dice again
   ESCape - Exits the program
	C - Change # of dice to roll.  Change takes 	effect on the next dice roll

	R - Reads the result of each dice rolled
	EX:  3 dice:  three     one   one

BTW:  the DICE_NS.EXE file is a light version of the program described above.  This version does not play sounds, thus no other files are required.
