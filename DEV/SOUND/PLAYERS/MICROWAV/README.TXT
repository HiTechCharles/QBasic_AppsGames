Is Windows Media Player more than you need to audition a few tiny WAV sounds? MicroWav is an alternative to this monumental overkill. Unlike the way bloated Windows Media Player, MicroWav loads instantly. It's invisible, and is very stable. Just for fun, you can select and play multiple .wav files.

***MicroWav is a "Windows Bloat Fighter" and  a "One File Wonder" from MacGyver_Soft.

***NEW in V 1.0F: Converted to pure Assembly language. This reduced the already trim 18KB size down to 3KB! This should impress Boomer to no end. :)

NOTE: Some XP SP-2 users report the new 3KB EXE will not work, so the old EXE is included. You can re-name it to "microwav.exe" if you wish.

***Installation***

Experts: 

Unzip, associate with .wav files and enjoy.


Non-experts:

1. Unzip the executable into the Windows folder, or wherever you wish.

2. Using the Windows Explorer, find a .wav file, and hold down shift while right-clicking the mouse on the file.  Select "Open With". When the "Open With" dialog appears, check "Always use this program to open these files". Now press the "Other" button,  browse to and select MicroWav.exe. Click "OK", and you're done!

To test MicroWav, simply click on any .wav file, and it should play instantly without any lag. Isn't that refreshing? :-)

Please note that MicroWav is completely INVISIBLE. You must click a .wav file, not MicroWav.exe. This is normal, and helps fight Windows bloat.


NOTE: To uninstall, use the above procedure again, except choose Windows Media Player or your favorite media player Executable instead of MicroWav.
