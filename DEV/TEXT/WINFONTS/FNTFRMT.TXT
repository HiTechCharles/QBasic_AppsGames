FileVersion Structure:
     Version (INTEGER)  - Version used to generate this file

[CharInfo] Structure:
     CharWidth  (WORD)  - Character Width in Pixels
     CharHeight (WORD)  - Character Height in Pixels
     FileOffset (DWORD) - Pointer to graphic data in file (CharData)

[CharData] Image:
