           ---------------  Some introduction -------------------------                              
                                                                             
   CONASCII can be used to create text based Boxes or screens for PBCC, PBdos,
   Qbasic, QB4.5 and QB4.0. 

                                                                               
   Press the Right Mouse Button to select the Drop Down Menu and right click 
   twice to turn it off if you don't select from the Drops while they are    
   being displayed.                                                          
                                                                             
   There is 99 screen in this program. If you were to Click on Page at the   
   Tool Bar 99 times, you would see 99 screens of nothing. Or if you were to 
   Click on the  …ÕÕÕÕπ line on the Tool Bar and tap the down Arrow key about
   2400 times you would scroll to screen 99 drawing a line that was 2400 rows
   deep. Left Clicking on Row, Page, Txcolor, Bgcolor will advance them to   
   the next and Right clicking on them will advance them to the previous.    
                                                                             
   The Copy tool in this program does not copy to Windows ClipBoard the same 
   way as other programs. There are many types of Copy located in the Area   
   Drop on the Menu which is covered below.                                
                                                                             

                                                                                
              ---------------- Click on Area --------------------                                       
                                                                                
  To select an area for Copy, Cut, Color, Edit and other selections from the    
  Drop Down Menu, click on the opposite diagional corners with the left mouse   
  button.

            --------------- Typing Text on the Screen -----------------

   Just type the way you normally do and when you hit Enter the cursor will 
   go to the next line on column one. If you want to add Extended ASCII
   charecters, right Click for Menu and click on Misc and Extended ASCII and
   the charecter you want to add. Hit Esc to clear the Arrow Keys of the 
   charecter. Space Bar and Back Space will remove text from the screen.
   The arrow keys will move the cursor around the screen without destroying
   any text. There is no Insert or Delete charecters, only strike over. When
   you get good enough, you can use Copy, Cut and Paste to edit lines with.

   It would be easier to Select the area you want text in and use Edit on the
   the Bar when you need a lot of Text, since it has full editing.
 
         


     ----------- Margin ON and OFF -------------
   
   It is easier to type on the screen if you set
   Margin on at the column you want your text to
   start. You can hit Enter several times without
   it inserting new lines. Without the Margin 
   being on, when you hit Enter once, the cursor
   goes to a new line at column one. If you hit
   Enter the second time without typing anything
   a new line is inserted.            
                                            
   Margin is under the Misc Drop on the Menu.
   Margin On sets the left hand Margin to the 
   program cursor position. There is no right 
   hand Margin, you will have to Hit Enter to 
   go to the next line. If you want to use    
   word wrap, use Edit, see Edit in Help.                       
                                            
   Margin Off is located in the same place on 
   the Drop Down Menu.                        



          ------------------ Insert Row  ------------------------          
                                 
   To insert a Row into the Screen, place the program cursor at the 
   beginning at Column one and hit the Enter key.                  
                                 
 
          ------------------ Delete Row ------------------------           
                                 
   To delete a row click on column one on the row you want to      
   delete and then hit the delete key.                            
                                 


         ------------------- LINE DRAWING -------------------------              
                                         
    Notice on the Bottom Bar next to the TxColor selection, there is a    
    image of double lines. Left Click on it and it is selected and Right   
    Click on it and it is changed.
                                
    Locate the Mouse cursor to where you want to start and Left Click.    
    That places the program cursor to that location.                       
                                         
    With the Arrow Keys draw the lines any direction you want.              
                                         
    Sometimes after changing to a different line, the starting         
    charecter is wrong. To correct it, place the mouse cursor on it and     
    click, then hit spacebar and restart your line. It should work this
    time. 

    Try drawing a Box with one of the lines. Then click inside the box
    at diagional corners without clicking on the line corners, then click
    on Edit. Type enough text to fill most of the Edit dialog and then
    click OK. Notice how the text is placed inside the frame you drew.


   ----------ForeGround and BackGround Color ----------          
                                                   
  I'm sure you have noticed and tried the TxColor  
  and BgColor on the Bottom Bar. If you haven't,   
  when you left click on one of them they will     
  change colors and that will be the color that    
  is applied to the screen when you type something 
  or use the Color tool on the Bottom Bar.         
                                                   
  Right click on them and they will change colors  
  in reverse. 
  
  When you get both colors the same the labels will
  disappear including the line tool label. Just click
  on it again and they will reappear.                                     

      

       ----------------- Opening Files ------------------                        
                                                               
  Files that has a color attribute, like Binary and Bload,     
  Has their own extentions and must keep that extention to     
  be loaded properly. The program reads extentions to 
  load files correctly.                                         
                                                               
  .BNY is used for old DOS multiscreen binary files. It is     
  slow to load but twice as small in size as .BNA file types.  
                                                               
  .BNA is also a Multiscreen binary that is quite large, but   
  super fast to load. I like it the best for multiscreens.     
                                                               
  .POP is a Saved portion of the Screen with it's original     
  address stored at the beginning.                             
                                                               
  .BSA is a Bsaved file. If you have a Bsaved file with a      
  different extention, you will need to change it to BSA       
  to get it to load correctly.                                 
                                                               
  All other extentions will load as Text files.                
                                                               
  To Load, click on Open on Drop Down Menu, then file type,    
  then File Name, and then OK. 

  
                                                                   
          ---------------- Saving to Files -----------------                     
                                                                       
  The Screens created to be stored in the Source's DATA statement can  
  be either Saved to a .INC file or put it in the ClipBoard by         
  clicking on  Area  and then on  Area to CB  in the Drop down Menu.   
                                                                       
  To Save to an INCLUDE file click, use Copy first, (see Copy) then 
  click on Save and Enter a Name with an INC extention under File Name.
  When ask if to Create file, click on yes. If it is a new file a screen
  launcher Sub will be added this one time along with the first Subroutine.
  Everything else that is added will be attached  to the end of the file
  and will also include a DECLARE statement along with it's matching
  Subroutine.             
                                                                       
  The .BNY file stores many DOS Binary screens. It is slow to Load.    
                                                                       
  The .BNA file stores API Compatible fast loading Binary screens.     
                                                                       
  The .POP file stores a Box or area along with it's location address.
                                                                         
  The .BSA file stores a BSAVED screen that can be used with BLOAD.    
                                                                       
  DDA stores the DOS version of the DATA Screens and it's launcher.  



  To Display a POP file in your PBCC programs, first load it in a String.
  Will need WIN32API.INC
  
  ff = FREEFILE

   To Display a POP file using PBDOS


  OPEN filename$ FOR INPUT AS #1                      ' P O P     F I L E S

     ro% = r2% - r1%
     FOR x = 1 TO ro% + 1
       POKE$  col1%, sa$(x)
       INCR col1%, 160
     NEXT x
     MouseShowCursor
   END SUB

   The string could have been chopped up into lines
   using MID$, but I already had this Sub created.

   QBasic probably could display this POP file with a little alteration
   of the Launching Sub that is included with DATA screens.

   Like the Screens in DATA, POP files will display in the positions
   they were created.





     --------------- Copy PBCC Code to ClipBoard-------------                     
                                                                
    This selection can be used seperately from the Mouse tool

    different options. A Screen Only option or Include Launch   
    SUB option.                                                 
                                                                
    Include Launch SUB option is for first time use, when the   
    program hasn't received any DATA Screens.                   
                                                                
    The Screen only option, you get a SUB with the screen stored
    in DATA and there is no Launcher SUB included. If you have  
    previously put a screen in your program, the Launcher will  
    already be there and you wouldn't need it again.  

 

    
       ---------Copy PBdos or QB Screen Code to ClipBoard---------           
                                                          
       If you want to store your screens in DATA using PBdos     
       or QB, copy the Area using the Copy Tool at the Bottom    
       Bar and Right Click for Menu and select Area. Then        
       select Copy PBdos Screen Code to ClipBoard on the Area    
       Drop. A Box will pop up requiring a Label name for the    
       screen. Another box will POP up asking which Basic to     
       use. Last Box will pop up asking if you want to include   
       the Launching Code. If it is the first time to store a    
       screen in DATA, click yes.                         
                                                          
       You can now paste it into your favorite Text editor. 

             

      ---------------- QB & PBdos DATA screens to File --------------------                              
                                                                                
  Screens or boxes are created the same way for both compilers. I have created  
  them for PB3, QB4, QB4.5 and QBasic.                
                                                                                
  You can use the file system to save them to a basic file or put them into     
  the Windows ClipBoard. Using the File system lets you Append every newly      
  created screen to the end of one file if your want more than one screen.      
  The program will check file you choose to see if it has any bytes, if there   
  is no bytes, it will know it is newly created and includes a Launcher Sub     
  with the Screen or Box DATA. If it sees Bytes, only the Data screen, caller,  
  label and Restore Label is Appended excluding the Launcher Sub.               
                                                                                
  Save to File: Click on the corners of chosen area, see Click on Area in Help. 
                Click on Copy at tool bar. Right Click Mouse for Drop Down.     
                Click on File then Save.                                        
                Under the Folder Label in Save Dialog, select your folder.      
                Under List Files of Type, click on PBdos & QB DATA (*.BAS)      
                Under File name: label Type in your file name with .BAS ext.    
                When asked to Create dialog pops up, click on Yes.              
                When Enter Label Name Box pops up Enter a name for your screen  
                When Choose Basic Box pops up click on the one you are using.   
                                                                                
  If you choose to add more screens to that file Everything will be appended    
  to the end. It seems like a lot to do, but it needs to generate correct code. 

 



      ------------Text to ClipBoard----------     


     There is something extra for selecting    
     the area of text. Make sure your last     
     click is on a space one charecter father  
     than your longest line or the first click 
     is one charecter before the start of the  
     lines. Making the first click on the start
     and the last click even with the longest  
     line will cause the last word on the      
     longest line and the first word on the    
     next line to be jammed together since     
     a space was not copied to seperate them.  
                                               
       click---> The quick red fox             
                 jumped over the               
                 lazy dog's back.  <---Click   
                                               
     Since there was no space copied after fox 
     or before jumped it would read:           
     The quick red foxjumped over the lazy     
     dog's back.                               
                                               
     After text is selected Click on Area and  
     Copy Regular Text to Clipboard on Menu 


   

    ------------- Copy Text with lines to clipboard --------------              
                                                                    
     Copying regular text without any drawn lines doesn't need any  
     returns since it needs  to word wrap when it is pasted in the  
     Edit box for editing, so drawn lines would get messed up.      
                                                                    
     This method of copying text to clipboard will paste the text   
     in NotePad looking the same way it was when copied. If NotePad 
     is setup with Terminal font and Wordwrap is off, all drawn     
     lines should display properly.                                 


                                                                                
     -------------------Selecting Mouse and Key Sensitive Words---------------- 

    Mouse Sensitive words are words that you put on the screen that you want
    to click on with you mouse to do a certain function. You can select as 
    many as you want. The Help menu on this program was created with it.
    There is an example of the generated output on the PowerBasic Source code
    forum. It was designed for use with PBCC.                                                                         
      
                                                                                
                                              click  click                      
    1. Select the first Character of a word...            and the last one.   
                                                  Edit                          
                                                                                
    2. Click on Mouse at the bottom bar. A reddish Flash will cover the word.   
       If the Flash covers a different area and not your word, you didn't get   
       in solid clicks. Redo the above, you may have to delete that part out of 
       your generated code, which is easy to do.                                
                                                                                
    3. Click on two diagonal corners of your screen or area and click on Copy   
                                                                                
    4. Right Click the Mouse for the Menu and Click on Area and then click on   
       Copy PBCC Screen Code to Clipboard                                       
                                                                                
    5. When the 6 boxes pop up click in the Include All box if it is your       
       first time to make mouse word selections on this screen. 

    The default Key sensitive character is the first character of the word      
    you select, to choose a different one, change MID$ position parameter.                    
                                                                                
    You should now have generated source code in your windows ClipBoard.        
                                                                                


      ------------------ Reset Console Size --------------------                       
                                                              
                                                              
    To Reset your working screen size, Right click for Menu   
    and click on Misc, then click on Reset Console Size.      
                                                              
    Because the Bottom Bar takes up one Row at the Bottom,    
    you will want to enter a one digit larger number for the  
    Row. To get a 28 row viewable screen you would have to    
    enter 29 instead and the Bottom Bar will locate on row 29.
                                                              
    If you enter larger numbers, scroll bars will be added.   


      ----------------- Edit-------------------------                         
                                                     
     Edit will let you create new Text or you can    
     Edit old text from off of the screen.           
                                                     
     To Create new Text, on the Screen click on the  
     Area you want to place the text in, same as     
     you would to select an area for Copy, Cut       
     and Color, but click on Edit instead. Type      
     in your text in the Edit Box and click on OK    
     when you are done.                              
                                                     
     To Edit existing Text on the screen, You must   
     first copy it into the Window ClipBoard. Then   
     Cut the old text out. Then reselect your area   
     like above and click on Edit. Click in the      
     Edit Box with your Right mouse button and click 
     on Paste. Edit your text and click on OK.       
                                                     
     I don't use Edit very much, since it wordwraps  
     everything and messes up the formatting. I      
     could write one paragraph at a time.

        --------------------- Some Tips -------------------------
                                        
    As mentioned before, the only editing that can be done on this type of   
    Screen can only be Strike Over, Insert Line and Delete line. There is    
    a few tricks with Copy and Paste that can help a bit.                    
                                                                             
    Now is the time for all goomen to come to the aid of their country.      
                                                                             
    You could correct that by first clicking on m in goomen and clicking     
    on period at the end of the line and click on Copy.                      
                                                                             
                                                                     
    The Cursor will return to m and you can type d and space and click       
    on Paste on the Bar.
