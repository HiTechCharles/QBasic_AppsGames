All-Star Bingo Caller 
By Martin Software.


Installation
Unzip all of the files into one directory.  Inside this directory should be another directory called SOUNDS; the following file types go in it:  *.wav  *.mp3  play.exe

OPERATION
Run BINGO.EXE to play Bingo.  The buttons you can use are shown on the intro screen.  Pressing 0 in the game also shows these commands.

the BINGO_NS.EXE does not use sound.  It does not need the SOUNDS directory to work.  BINGO.EXE uses this sounds directory.

If you run either of the BINGO programs under windows 95/higher, hold ALT, then press ENTER to make the program fill the screen if it starts in a small window.
