OBJECT OF THE GAME
Cards are dealt face down into two rows of six.  The
Object of the Game is to find and remove all matching
pairs of cards.


PLAYING
Cards you can flip are labeled with the letters A through L.
As you remove cards, letters will become unavailable.

1   Flip over two cards by pressing the card's letter.
2   If the two cards are a pair, they are removed from the grid.
    Otherwise, they are turned face down.
3   If you find three pairs in a row without a miss, you get a bonus.
4   When all pairs have been found and the board is empty,
    your score is displayed, and the game ends.


SCORING
2 points for every pair you find.  (Always will be 24)
Lose 2 points for every miss.
6 points if you find 3 pairs in a row.  (A triplet)

The top ten best scores are saved, and you can see the list after finishing
a game.  -Delete the file MEMMATCH.HI to clear the scores, and game options.


OPTIONS
During gameplay, the following keys can be used:

     S - Turns sound effects on and off.
     R - Turns speech on and off.  (Announces the letter hit, and the cards
         that get flipped over.)
	 M - Reads out loud the card letters that can be chosen.
ESCape - Quit the game entirely.

When the speech or sound settings are changed, they are saved so that the
options will be the same next time the game is started.
