                                 Instructions


     Tic Tac Toe is a game for 2 players.  The game is played on a 9-square
board. (See figure 1.)  The object of the game is to get three of your pieces
in a row; either going across, down or diagonally.

GETTING STARTED:

     First, you need a board to play on.  Draw two lines going up and down,
then draw two lines going left to right THROUGH the set you just drew.  After
you draw the board, you should have 9 small squares.  (See figure 2)  Next,
each player chooses a piece to draw in the squares they want.  One player gets
an X, the other player gets the O.  (letter O)

HOW TO PLAY:

     After you draw a board and choose pieces, it's time to play!  Decide who
will go first.  Now, the player that will be going first draws their piece
(either an X or an O) in one of the nine squares.  Now, the other player marks
another square with their piece.  You cannot take a square that already has an
X or an O in it.  You only mark one square per turn.

WINNING
     
     If a player gets 3 X's in a row, or 3 O's in a row, that player that drew
the x's or o's wins.  If there is no winner, it's a tie.  A tie is also called
a "cat's game."  (See figure 3)

HOW TO PLAY THIS COMPUTERIZED VERSION

     You can have any combination of players.  You can have two human players,
a human against the computer, or two computer players against each other.  

     When you first see the board, it will look exactly like Figure 2 above.  A
number wil be in each square that you can choose.  To place your piece, push
the number that matches  the square you want.  For example, if you push
the number 5, your piece will be on the middle square.

HOW TO PLAY THE CARD MODE

     Instead of the players choosing where you want your pieces, you draw
cards that decide where your pieces will go.  Cards include the squares 1-9,
wild, and lose a turn.  The wild card lets you choose any open square you
want.  The lose a turn card makes you skip your turn.  Try it.  It's fun!
